# Thunderbird Add-on Distribution Agreement

## 1. Introduction

MZLA is committed to promoting choice and innovation on the web. From the launch of Thunderbird, we’ve allowed anyone to create and distribute Thunderbird Add-ons.

This Thunderbird Add-on Distribution Agreement \("Agreement"\) governs Your distribution of Thunderbird Add-ons. Frequently used terms in this Agreement are defined below.

* “Add-on” means software that extends the functionality of Thunderbird, for example, extensions, themes \(defined below\), search providers, dictionaries, and language packs. Add-ons are also commonly referred to as extensions or plugins.
* “Add-on Manager” is the Thunderbird tool to manage Add-ons. It can be accessed from the Thunderbird menu button in the toolbar.
* “ATN” means addons.thunderbird.net, which is our online platform for developers to list and distribute Add-ons to End-Users.
* “theme” means software that personalizes the look of Thunderbird. Themes are a type of Add-on.
* “Brand Features” mean the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features of You, Mozilla or MZLA.
* “End-Users” mean individuals who install Add-Ons, or to whom Add-ons are promoted.
* “Thunderbird” means the awesome email client developed by the Thunderbird community.
* “Listed Add-on” means Add-ons that are listed and distributed on ATN.
* “Mozilla” means Mozilla Corporation and its affiliated entities.
* “MZLA” means [todo] and designated community members who are part of the Add-on review process.
* “Unlisted Add-on” means Add-ons that are distributed to End-Users via means other than ATN.
* “You” means the person or entity entering this Agreement for the purpose of distributing a Thunderbird Add-on.

## 2. Accounts

In order to distribute an Add-on, You'll need to create an account. During registration, You will be asked to set a password. You are responsible for keeping Your password confidential and for the activity that happens through Your account. MZLA is not responsible for any losses arising out of unauthorized use of Your account.

## 3. Privacy policy

Mozilla’s [Websites, Communications and Cookies Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/websites/) describes what information we receive from developers and how we use that information. We use the information we receive as described in Mozilla’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/).

## 4. Distribution & review process

#### **\(a\) Distribution Options**

* Listed Add-ons: You can request Your Add-on to be listed and distributed on ATN. ATN is a popular site with over four billion Add-on downloads. End-Users can search titles, navigate categories, or view promoted, featured, popular, or top rated Add-ons. End-Users can also rate Add-ons and leave comments.
* Unlisted Add-ons: Add-ons that are distributed by a method outside of ATN are common when an Add-on isn’t intended for the public or is bundled with another Add-on. For example, some Add-ons are created by a company for employees; created for research purposes by a limited group; or are in development or testing phase and not yet suitable for a general audience.

#### **\(b\) Review Process**

Listed and Unlisted Add-ons ****must meet certain review criteria, which are described in our [Review Policies](review-policy-for-thunderbird-add-ons.md)**.** MZLA may at any time monitor, test or review Listed and Unlisted Add-ons for compliance with this Agreement and the [Review Policies](review-policy-for-thunderbird-add-ons.md). The inclusion of an Add-on on ATN is at MZLA’s sole discretion.

## 5. Your obligations

You represent and warrant that:

\(a\) Relationship with MZLA. You will provide accurate information and updates to MZLA during registration and any communications with MZLA in connection with Your Add-ons. The descriptions and other data You provide about the Add-on are true to the best of Your knowledge. Unless You and MZLA have a written agreement stating otherwise, Your Add-on will not imply in any way that it is produced, sponsored or endorsed by MZLA.

\(b\) Relationship with End-Users. As between You and MZLA, You are solely responsible for Your Add-ons and the relationship between You and Your End-Users. You will provide accurate information and updates to Your End-Users about Your Add-ons, including disclosure of all security permissions and End-User data necessary for the Add-on to function. You are solely responsible for providing reasonable technical support to End-Users and You will make appropriate support contact information available.

\(c\) Intellectual Property Rights. You have and will maintain all necessary copyright, trademark, patent or other proprietary or legal rights to post, display, perform, use, reproduce, distribute and transmit Your Add-on, worldwide, as well as the rights to authorize others \(including MZLA\) to do the same.

\(d\) Export Restrictions. Your distribution of Add-ons may be subject to United States export laws and regulations. You will comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to Your distribution of Add-ons. These laws include restrictions on destinations, users and end use.

## 6. Licenses; proprietary rights

MZLA encourages You to make Your Add-ons available under open source licenses such as the MPL for source code and a Creative Commons license for creative works.

You hereby grant to MZLA a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license under all of Your rights necessary to review Your Add-ons \(including the source code, if required\); and publish, distribute, and promote Listed Add-ons as part of ATN or related MZLA promotional efforts.

Between MZLA and You, each party shall own all right, title and interest, including without limitation all intellectual property rights, relating to its Brand Features. MZLA does not grant You any intellectual property rights not specifically stated in this Agreement. For example, this Agreement does not provide You the right to use any of Mozilla’s or MZLA’s Brand Features. Thunderbird and ATN are distributed under and subject to the current version of the Mozilla Public License, or other similarly permissive licenses.

## 7. Content removal

#### \(a\) Removal from Distribution by You.

You may cease distribution of Your Add-ons at any time by removing your Add-on from ATN. You agree that ceasing maintenance or distribution of Add-ons does not necessarily remove Your Add-on from End-User machines, hardware, or other devices, or from any part of ATN where previously downloaded applications are stored on behalf of End-Users \(if any\).

#### \(b\) Removal from Distribution by MZLA.

MZLA reserves the right \(though not the obligation\) to, in our sole discretion, remove or revoke access to any Listed or Unlisted Add-ons. This applies, but is not limited to, Add-ons that, in our reasonable opinion, violate this Agreement or the law, any applicable Mozilla or MZLA policy, or is in any way harmful or objectionable. In addition, we may at any time remove Your Add-on from ATN; blocklist an Add-on; delete your ATN account; flag, filter, modify related materials \(including but not limited to descriptions, screenshots, or metadata\); reclassify the Add-on; or take other corrective action.

For example, a Listed Add-on may be removed in response to abuse reports from End-Users, in response to a Take-Down Request, or if it comes to MZLA’s attention that the Add-on violates our Conditions of Use. An Unlisted Add-on may be blocklisted if it comes to MZLA’s attention that it violates the Security Criteria described in our [Review Policies](review-policy-for-thunderbird-add-ons.md).

In addition, we may at any time suspend or terminate this Agreement with You if we are no longer going to support the products and services related to Thunderbird Add-ons.

#### \(c\) Take Down Request.

For information on how to notify Mozilla / MZLA in connection with claimed copyright or trademark infringement \(“Take-Down Request”\) see [here](https://www.mozilla.org/about/legal/report-abuse/) [todo: rebrand?].

## 8. Disclaimer of warranties

ATN, MZLA PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”. MZLA, ITS CONTRIBUTORS & LICENSORS, DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

## 9. Limitation of liability

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, MZLA, ITS CONTRIBUTORS & LICENSORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT MZLA OR ITS AGENTS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING. IN NO EVENT SHALL MZLA’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS BE IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF \(i\) $100 OR \(ii\) THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID TO YOU BY MZLA IN THE TWELVE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE INITIAL NOTICE OF ANY CLAIM. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF LIABILITY, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

## 10. Release; indemnification

You release MZLA, its officers, employees, agents and successors from claims, demands and damages of every kind or nature arising out of or related to any disputes with End-Users, including other Add-on developers.

If any third party brings a claim against MZLA related to Your use of ATN or Your Add-ons, You will defend and hold MZLA harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind \(including reasonable legal fees and costs\) related to such claim.

## 11. General legal terms

#### \(a\) Governing Law & Language.

THESE TERMS, AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH MZLA UNDER THESE TERMS, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS.

You and MZLA agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, in the state of California to resolve any legal matter arising from these Terms. Notwithstanding this, You agree that MZLA shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies \(or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief\) in any jurisdiction. In the event of conflicts between a translated version of this Agreement and the English language version, the English language version shall control.

#### \(b\) Severability; No Waiver. 

If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of this Agreement are invalid, then that provision will be removed from this Agreement without affecting the rest of the Agreement. The remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. You agree that if MZLA does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in this Agreement \(or which MZLA has the benefit of under any applicable law\), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of MZLA’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to MZLA.

Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between You and MZLA for distribution of Add-ons, and completely supersedes any other related agreements between You and MZLA unless You have a separately negotiated and signed agreement in connection with a specific Add-on \("Custom Agreement"\), in which case the Custom Agreement controls. Hyperlinked documents in this Agreement, including for example, [Review Policies](review-policy-for-thunderbird-add-ons.md), are incorporated herein by reference.

#### \(c\) Termination

To terminate this Agreement You must provide MZLA with 30 days prior written notice of such termination. Sections 8-11 of this Agreement shall survive termination.

#### \(d\) Assignment

The rights granted in this Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by You without the prior written approval of MZLA. You are not permitted to delegate Your responsibilities or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written approval of MZLA.

#### \(e\) Modification

MZLA may periodically update this Agreement. The updated Agreement will be available online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through MZLA’s usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts, forums, or email. Your continued distribution of Your Add-on after the effective date of such changes constitutes Your acceptance of such changes. To make Your review more convenient, we will post an effective date on the Agreement.
